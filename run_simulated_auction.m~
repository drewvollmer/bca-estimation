btypes = randi([1 3], 9, 1);
%% Note that this assumes the three types of bidders are uniformly distributed. Will need to change
%% that for the full estimation.

% icdfs is an inverse CDF. It takes in a quantile and returns a bid
% Take a random uniform draw on [0, 1]. Then find the bid corresponding to that amount of tail
% probability in the relevant CDF
% It probably is more efficient to calculate the inverse CDF!

% Take 9 uniform draws for competing bids
bid_quantiles = randi([1 1000], 9, 1);

% Get bids
bids = inv_cdfs( sub2ind( size(inv_cdfs), btypes, (4 - auction_type)*ones(9, 1), bid_quantiles ) );
% This matches draws in simulate3-clean.cc: inv_cdf(btype, 4 - type, quantile) works. (type = 1
% corresponds to the third type in my CDF.)
%% So: is my inverse CDF matrix indexed wrong?  Is the 4 - correction necessary?

% Evaluate selection probability and derivative
utilities = ( nlogit_params.c6_price*[auctions.bidAmount(i); bids] + nlogit_params.c6_sellrep*([auctions.btype(i); btypes] - 1) ) ...
    / nlogit_params.nestCorr;

% Get inclusive value
incl_value = log( sum(exp( utilities - max(utilities) )) ) + max(utilities);

%% lnnumreps, buyrep, and prevcancel are all defined based on data for this bid
topUtil = nlogit_params.c7_cons + nlogit_params.c7_lnnumreps*log(bid.NumReps + 1) + ...
          nlogit_params.c7_buyrep*(bid.SumRep / bid.NumReps) + ...
          nlogit_params.c7_lnprevcancel*log(bid.PreviousCancels + 1);

%% Track down the formulas used here and why they are correct
A = exp(topUtil + nlogit_params.nestCorr*incl_value);
B = exp(utilities(1) - max(utilities));
C = sum(exp( utilities - max(utilities) ));

prob = A/(1+A) * B/C;
%% Where does the formula for the derivative come from here?
prob_deriv = (  prob * nlogit_params.c6_price * (B/(C*(1+A)) + 1/nlogit_params.nestCorr*(1 - B/C)));
